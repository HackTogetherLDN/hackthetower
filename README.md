# Hack the Tower website

A HTML5 responsive design website created with the help of bootstrap, with the aim of not maining the site seem too bootstrapy!

Hack the Tower is a regular (monthly, give or take) hack day held in the London offices of Salesforce.  The aim is to have a space where developers can come together and collaborate on projects and try out new technology together.  We do more and learn better when we help each other.

The site started off with a simple design, from the boot strap tutorial at:

The United bootstrap theme was applied from:

Buttons for the sign-up section were copied from the example:

All the other bootstrap components were added from the examples on:
